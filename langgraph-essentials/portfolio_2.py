 LangGraph Essentials | Module 04 | CLAIM SETTLEMENT AGENT WITH A LIVE ADJUSTER
================================================================================

 THE PROBLEM
 -----------
 A motor insurance company receives thousands of claims a day. Two facts are in
 tension:

   - Most claims are small and obvious. Paying them by hand is slow and costly.
   - Some claims are large or suspicious. Paying those automatically is reckless.

 So the business question is not "can a machine settle claims?" It is:

        WHICH claims can be settled without a person,
        and for the rest, how does a person get involved
        without stopping the whole pipeline?

 WHAT WE ARE BUILDING
 --------------------
 A graph that investigates a claim, scores it, and then decides WHO decides.

   1. An AGENT gathers facts using tools (policy, claim history, garage quote).
      The LLM chooses which tools to call and how many times.

   2. PYTHON scores the claim. Not the LLM. The amount that leaves the bank is
      decided by arithmetic you can read, because a regulator will ask why.

   3. A ROUTER checks the score and the amount:
        small and clean   -> settle automatically, no human
        large or risky    -> PAUSE and ask a human adjuster

   4. The ADJUSTER can APPROVE, MODIFY the amount, or REJECT. Each answer sends
      the graph down a different path. The human is a branch, not a rubber stamp.

 CLAIM SETTLEMENT DESK
========================================================================
 THE PROBLEM
   Most motor claims are small and obvious -- settling them by hand is
   slow and expensive. Some are large or suspicious -- settling those
   automatically is reckless. So: which claims need a human, and how
   does that human step in without stopping everything else?

 WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES
   1. An AGENT investigates the claim using tools. The LLM chooses
      which tools to call.
   2. PYTHON scores the claim. Not the LLM -- the payout figure has to
      be auditable.
   3. A ROUTER checks score and amount:
        small + clean  -> settle automatically
        large or risky -> stop and ask a human
   4. The ADJUSTER approves, modifies the amount, or rejects. Each
      answer takes a different path through the graph.

 TWO CLAIMS FOLLOW.
   The first settles on its own. The second will stop and ask you.

 WHAT JUST HAPPENED
========================================================================
 1. THE LOOP. investigate -> tools -> investigate is a CYCLE. The model
    decided how many times it went round, not you. That cycle is the
    difference between a workflow and an agent.

 2. IT WORKS BECAUSE OF add_messages. Each pass appended the tool
    results to the conversation. With the default reducer the agent
    would forget every result and loop until it hit the limit.

 3. THE LLM GATHERED, PYTHON DECIDED. assess() is arithmetic. No
    language model chose the amount that left the bank.

 4. THE HUMAN WAS A BRANCH. Run it again and answer differently --
    approve, modify, reject take three different paths to three
    different outcomes, with no code change.

 5. PAUSED MEANT PAUSED. While it waited for you, nothing was running
    and no tokens were being spent. The state sat in the checkpointer
    under its thread_id. An adjuster answering three days later would
    be the identical call.

 TRY THIS: run it again and choose 2 (modify) with a very small amount.
 Then run it once more and choose 3. Same claim, same code, three
 different business outcomes.
